    The method takes the found EFMs and constructs the reaction graph in the following way:
    nodes are marked with reaction ids (or -r_id for the reversed versions of reversible reactions),
    there exists an edge between nodes r_i and r_j iff they are related, i.e.
    there exists at least efm_num of EFMs that contain both reaction r_i and reaction r_j.
    The method then detects the maximal cliques of size greater or equal to min_clique_size.

    :param efm_num: int (optional, default value is 2), minimal number of EFMs that should contain two reactions
    for them to be considered related.
