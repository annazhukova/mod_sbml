    """
    Classifies EFMs to find common patterns.

    :param efms: list of EFMs, which are represented as tuples (binary_representation, non_zero_coefficients).

    A binary representation of an EFM is a list of integers whose binary representations
    correspond to the reactions that are active in the EFM: if the reaction is active,
    the corresponding bit is set to 1.
    If the total number of reactions in the model is larger that the number of bits in an int, several ints are used.

    Example: For a model containing reactions r1, r2(reversible), r3(reversible), r4, r5,
    a EFM: 3 r1, -2 r2, 1 r3, 1 r5 would be represented as [77], as the binary representation of 77 is '1001101'
    that corresponds to '1 r5, 0 r4, 0 -r3, 1 r3, 1 -r2, 0 r2, 1 r1', where -ri is the reversed version of ri.
    The non_zero_coefficients for this EFM are [3, -2, 1, 1].

    :param min_pattern_len: int, minimal length for a pattern to be considered.

    :param min_efm_num: int, (optional) at least how many EFMs should include a pattern for it to be considered.
    (The default value is 2.)

    :param max_pattern_num: int, (optional) at most how many patterns should be returned.
    If not set, all the patterns will be returned.

    :return: 2 dictionaries: p_id2efm_ids and id2pattern.
    p_id2efm_ids maps a pattern_id to ids of the EFMs containing this pattern,
    id2pattern maps a pattern_id to the binary representation of the pattern.

    A binary representation of a pattern is a list of integers whose binary representations
    correspond to the reactions that are active in this pattern: if the reaction is active,
    the corresponding bit is set to 1.
    If the total number of reactions in the model is larger that the number of bits in an int, several ints are used.

    Example: For a model containing reactions r1, r2(reversible), r3(reversible), r4, r5,
    a pattern: r1, r2, r3, r5 would be represented as [77], as the binary representation of 77 is '1001101'
    that corresponds to '1 r5, 0 r4, 0 -r3, 1 r3, 1 -r2, 0 r2, 1 r1', where -ri is the reversed version of ri.
